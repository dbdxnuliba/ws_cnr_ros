# scaled_fjt_controller: A controller to execute follow joint trajectory action

The repository contains the implementation of a FollowJointTrajectory server as a ROS controller based on the framework [_cnr_ros_control_](https://github.com/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/cnr_ros_control)

## TOPIC/ACTION

### Follow Joint Trajectory action server
The controller manager goal, cancel, preemption of a [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html)

The default action name is: /[ROBOTHW_NAME]/[CONTROLLER_NAME]/follow_joint_trajectory
You may want to remap it to the name defined in MoveIt!

### override
The controller subscribes several override topics.

For each override topic, a std_msgs/Int64 message could be sent. The message is a number between 0 and 100 (values outside the limits are saturated in the range 0-100), which scale the velocity, the acceleration, and time of the trajectory.

The global override is given by the product of the single override (for example: 10% * 5% = 0.5%)

The default override topic names are:

- speed_ovr
- safe_ovr_1
- safe_ovr_2

You can change the names and the number of the override topics by setting the parameter _overrides_ (array of string)

### Trajectory information
The controller publishes:

- Time of the unscaled trajectory. It's the nominal time of the current point of the trajectory. Type: <std_msgs::Float64>, name: /[ROBOTHW_NAME]/[CONTROLLER_NAME]/scaled_time.

- The execution ratio (or percentage). Type <std_msgs::Float64>, name /[ROBOTHW_NAME]/[CONTROLLER_NAME]execution_ratio

- The unscaled joint target is the tuple position/velocity of the nominal trajectory in the current point. Type: <sensor_msgs::JointState>, name: /[ROBOTHW_NAME]/[CONTROLLER_NAME]/unscaled_joint_target


## CONFIGURATION
``` yaml
  microinterpolator:
    type: "cnr/control/ScaledFJTPosController"
    controlled_joints: all

    ## OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    continuity_order: 1 # optional [default=1]. Continuity order of the trajectory.
    # 1 velocity is continouos [you should use this one if are using the default_planner_request_adapters/AddTimeParameterization in moveit_config]
    # 2 acceleration is continouos
    # 3 jerk is continouos
    # 4 snap is continouos
    overrides: ["ovr1", "ovr2", "ovr3"] #optional (default= [speed_ovr,safe_ovr_1,safe_ovr2])
    goal_tolerance: 0.001 # optional (default=0.001). it you be a scalar or any array with a value for each joint
    path_tolerance: 0.001 # optional (default=0.001). it you be a scalar or any array with a value for each joint
    check_tolerance: true # optional (default=true). if true, goal ends when the joint states and targets are in tolerance. Use false if there is a compliant controller in the loop.
```
